It slowly changes color from green to red as it gets ripe, and as it gets ripe it gets bigger and bigger. There are many different types of tomatoes. Some kinds of tomato are yellow or orange when they are ripe. Tomatoes are used a lot in Italian food. They are also used to make ketchup. Tomatoes are called fruit, because they contain seeds. Tomato seeds are dispersed by being eaten by animals. After being eaten the seeds pass through the animal's digestive system. Although tomatoes are botanically fruits, many people consider them vegetables and treat them as such in cooking.</p>

        <p id="importance">Plants are living organisms that can live on land or water. They have many different forms such as huge trees, others are herbs or some have bushy form. The basic food for all organisms is produced by green plants. Plants help in maintaining oxygen balance, the most important gas that enable us to breathe. Animals emit carbon dioxide by taking in oxygen. This rise in carbon dioxide levels in air is reduced by plants. Removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere reduces the greenhouse effect and global warming. It also maintains the ozone layer that helps protect Earth’s life from damaging UV radiation. Humans directly or indirectly depend on plants for several of their needs.</p>
